# Starting monitor mode

Airmon-ng can be used to enable monitor mode on wireless interfaces. It may also be used to kill network managers, or go back from monitor mode to managed mode. Entering the `airmon-ng` command without parameters will show the wireless interface name, driver and chipset.

```bash
sudo airmon-ng
```


We can set the wlan0 interface into monitor mode using the command `airmon-ng start wlan0`.

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```


# Checking for interfering processes

When putting a card into monitor mode, it will automatically check for interfering processes. It can also be done manually by running the following command:

```bash
sudo airmon-ng check
```

# Starting monitor mode on a specific channel

It is also possible to set the wireless card to a specific channel using `airmon-ng`. We can specify the desired channel while enabling monitor mode on the wlan0 interface.

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 11
```

# Stopping monitor mode

We can stop the monitor mode on the `wlan0mon` interface using the command `airmon-ng stop wlan0mon`.

```bash
bradhinca@htb[/htb]$ sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```
