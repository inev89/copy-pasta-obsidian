[Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) comprises a comprehensive suite of tools designed for the evaluation of WiFi network security. Prior to initiating any endeavors to analyze or exploit wireless networks, a foundational understanding of the functionalities inherent within these tools is imperative.

Aircrack-ng focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

- `Monitoring`: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
- `Attacking`: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
- `Testing`: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).
- `Cracking`: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).
