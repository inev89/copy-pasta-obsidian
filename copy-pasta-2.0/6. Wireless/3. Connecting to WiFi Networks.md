# Connecting with CLI

To connect to a network via the command line, we would use `wpa_supplicant` along with a `configuration` file that contains the necessary network details. This allows us to authenticate and connect to the network directly from the terminal.

```bash
sudo iwlist wlan0 s | grep 'Cell\|Quality\|ESSID\|IEEE'
```

## Connecting to WEP Networks

If the target network is using WEP, connecting is straightforward. We just need to provide the `SSID`, the `WEP hex key`, and set the WEP key index using `wep_tx_keyidx` in a configuration file (e.g., wep.conf) to establish the connection. Additionally, we set `key_mgmt=NONE`, which is used for WEP or networks with no security.

```config
network={
	ssid="HackTheBox"
    key_mgmt=NONE
    wep_key0=3C1C3A3BAB
    wep_tx_keyidx=0
}
```

Once the configuration file is ready, we can use `wpa_supplicant` to connect to the network. We run the command with the `-c` option to specify the configuration file and the `-i` option to specify the network interface.

Connecting to Wi-Fi Networks

```bash
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wep.conf -i wlan0
```


## Connecting to WPA Networks

If the target network uses WPA/WPA2, we'll need to create a wpa_supplicant configuration file (eg: wpa.conf) with the correct `PSK` (Pre-Shared Key) and `SSID`. This file will look like the following:

Code: config

```config
network={
	ssid="HackMe"
    psk="password123"
}
```

Then we could initiate our wpa connection to the AP using the following command.

Connecting to Wi-Fi Networks

```bash
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wpa.conf -i wlan0
```

## Connecting to WPA Enterprise

If the target network uses WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (MGT), we'll need to create a wpa_supplicant configuration file with the correct `identity`, `password`, `SSID` and `key_mgmt`. This file will look like this:

Code: config

```config
network={
  ssid="HTB-Corp"
  key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
  identity="HTB\Administrator"
  password="Admin@123"
}
```

Once the configuration file is ready, we can use `wpa_supplicant` to connect to the network. We run the command with the `-c` option to specify the configuration file and the `-i` option to specify the network interface.

```bash
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wpa_enterprsie.conf -i wlan0
```

## Connecting with Network Manager Utilities

One of the ways that we can easily connect to wireless networks in Linux is through the usage of nmtui. This utility will give us a somewhat graphical perspective while connecting to these wireless networks.

Connecting to Wi-Fi Networks

```shell-session
sudo nmtui
```
