| Stored (Persistent)        | The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input in stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval.                                                  |
| Reflected (Non-Persistent) | Occurs when user input in displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored                                                              |
| DOM-based                  | Another non-persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server. |
